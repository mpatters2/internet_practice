title: YAMAHA Venture Lite - $3300

body:
It's been 10 great years that I have owned this sled. I'm the original owner as I purchased it off the show room floor. My girls and I have thoroughly enjoyed this baby but, I can't stand to walk by her anymore. Every time I walk into the barn she calls out to me "ride me, ride me like you used to". I just can't take how guilty she makes me feel. My girls are off to college and it's no fun ice fishing alone or riding single on a two person sled. It has to go. It runs great and has always had ample power. 

Fellas, if you are looking for a great two up that makes the girls want to climb aboard, this could be the pussy cat for you. Use the rear rack to show off your manly ice traps and bait bucket. If you really want to turn them on, fasten a tow behind sled and strap on your collapsible ice house. Of course, if there are no girls around, you can always let your dog ride on the back. 

Highlights: 
* 144" track
* front and rear hand warmers
* CSS Light System to warn on coming drivers
* After market 7" wide skis for improved flotation 
* 3095 miles
* windshield storage
